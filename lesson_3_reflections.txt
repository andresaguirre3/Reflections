When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
the remote repository can be useful whenever one wants to share a project to colaborate with other people.
in addition by having a remote reposity one can have access from different a computer or production environment 
to the repository. so in these kind of cases i would want to use remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is better to synchronize the repositories manually to have total control and magament of files as more people colaborate more files can be added probabbly in a short period of time in which this can leads to 
have dozens of unknown files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branches is a hierarchical history of commits starting from a base node to the latest node or last commit following a logical path defined by the branch. forks are clones between the githab servers in which can keep track the numbers of forks made by other account in githab. clones can happen in githab server and local computers.
